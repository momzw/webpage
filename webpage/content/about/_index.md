Hello! \
I'm Moritz, a PhD student at the University of Bern with a passion in physics. 
My interests span many fields of physics - from astronomy, to quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in physics, with minors in both mathematics and astronomy in 2021. 
During my studies of astronomy, I delved into many diverse topics such as astrodynamics, satellite geodesy, stellar nuclear 
physics, cosmology and the study of the early universe. 

Post-undergrad, I focused on theoretical physics with the goal of understanding
Einstein's theory of general relativity and deriving the Standard Model of particle physics - the current best description of the fundamentals of nature.
Although my master's was in theoretical physics, the University of Bern allowed me to write my thesis in the field of exoplanetary sciences.
Recently, the community started to delve deeper into the research of exomoons and I was able to contribute by creating a 
Monte-Carlo simulation module that allows for the tracking of material evaporated from moons akin to Jupiter's Io. \
You can find my paper on that topic [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JE007935)! 

Now, I'm a PhD student and I shifted my focus from exoplanets and theoretical physics to machine learning and solar physics.

And besides research? \
I'm a passionate dancer and enjoy the occasional gaming session! Both video-games and tabletop.
