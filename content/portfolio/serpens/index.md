_**S**imulating **R**ing **P**articles **E**mergent from **N**atural **S**atellites_.

Although exomoons, natural satellites beyond our solar system, are still undetectable in direct searches with 
state-of-the-art instruments, their existence has been hypothesized to explain various inconsistencies in exoplanetary 
spectra.

For my master's thesis, I developed a 3D test-particle Monte Carlo simulation module called SERPENS. This module is 
built to simulate the neutral outgassing and evolution of a satellite at multiple candidate exoplanet-exomoon systems 
to provide a number density and a line-of-sight column density map of the evolving particle environment.

Our results demonstrate how exomoons similar to Io, referred to as exo-Ios, can affect line-of-sight column 
densities depending on the phase of the exomoon at the time of observation. Thus, it is possible to model 
time-variable spectra by taking into account the phase of the exomoon.
